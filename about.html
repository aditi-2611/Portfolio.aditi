    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  My name is <strong>Aditi Mishra</strong>. I am originally from Rewa and currently
  living in Indore. I completed my schooling at St. John’s Higher Secondary School.
  Presently, I am pursuing my B.Tech in Engineering from Medi-Caps University.
  In terms of technical skills, I have hands-on experience in Java, HTML, CSS,
  and SQL, along with a basic understanding of Spring Boot. I have also completed
  an internship in AWS Cloud Foundation and Architecture, which helped strengthen
  my technical foundation and practical understanding. As an active member of the
  National Service Scheme (NSS), I have participated in several national-level
  activities and was selected for a national camp. Apart from academics, I am
  passionate about nature photography and cooking. My strengths include being
  adaptable, eager to learn new technologies, and maintaining a positive attitude
  toward challenges. Talking about my weakness, I sometimes push myself a little
  too hard in the pursuit of perfection.
